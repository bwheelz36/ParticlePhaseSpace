This folder contains example notebooks, which are directly used to build the [documentation](https://bwheelz36.github.io/ParticlePhaseSpace/examples.html).

If you would like to have an example notebook you wrote build into the docs, you have to place it in this folder, and then update the `docsrc/conf.py` and `examples.rst` in the docsrc folder.
